"""
This class additionally made for handling the connected_components method of GraphAlgo's class.
this implementation gives a very good time complexity for finding the connected components of a given Directed Graph in
a very efficient way.
the main structure of this implementation is based on the DFS algorithm.
each node is being checked only once by holding all checked elements in a data structure and assuring each iteration 
the given node hasn't been checked and applied for another connected component.
the wrapping element is the tarjan method, which handles the iteration as an alternative 
to the recursive implementation of Tarjan.
an iterator (itr) is marking each iteration to the outer elements of tarjan method each iteration.
at each end of the DFS iterations the scc_list, which holds all the components already found is extended by a new list.
the conversion of the recursive method to the iterative one has been done by the ideas explained in the following links:
